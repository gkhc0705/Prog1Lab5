Grades.java: Used file method to read a text file that I created, with java.

GCD.java: Used loop and it's a program that finds the GCD of two integers.

Book.java and BookInformation.java:
These two programs are together but in different files, Book.java which uses
the getter setter methods as long other methods required.
I wanted to make the program more advance by making into a loop, but it's not very
complete. BookInformation.java is where the loop and other codes are.

Object1.java and Encapsulation.java:
#57 of textbook questions that encapsulates the name of the student and his/her grades.
Encapsulation.java contains getters/setters methods as long as toString() and equals() methods.
and Object1 is to run the program.

Object2.java and Encapsulation2.java:
#55 of textbook questions that encapsulates the concept of the team.
Encapsulation2.java contains getters/setters methods as long as toString() and equals() methods.
and Object2 is to run the program.

Object3.java and Encapsulation3.java:
Finally, #56 of textbook questions that encapsulates the brand of television and its price.
Encapsulation3.java contains getters/setters methods as long as toString() and equals() methods.
and Object3 is to run the program.
